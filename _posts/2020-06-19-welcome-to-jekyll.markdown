I like to draw and I needed a catchy name for some graphics but could only think of my old graffiti tags.
Then I thought about this caption:

![Blackbeard](/assets/blackbeard.jpeg)

I've always been a dreamer. And I'll remain such.
I registered a domain and got `.cash` as an alternative to `.com`.
Perhaps it sounds deceitful, may be some will think it's arrogant or tacky. I don't care at all. I like it because it reminds me about the material, tangible realization of the abstract, idealistic dream. Many dreams need money, others don't, some even dream about money. It doesn't matter, just go and get it.

Have fun, Gio.
