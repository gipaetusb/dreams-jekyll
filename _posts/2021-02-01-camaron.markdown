As I write in my manifesto, I've fallen in love with the sea and I wanna set sail with Kaya (the white dog) as soon as possible.
*El Camarón Pistola* is the name of my minicat 310S. Being a grumpy catamaran, in contrast to elegant sailing boats, I'll use male pronouns to address him. He will teach me the sailing how-to's. The first training ground for us will be the Garda waters, later we'll try the dutch shores.

Here's a picture after his varo (inauguration), on the shores of Maderno.

And here's a small stripe I've written to celebrate the inauguration. I'm also gonna print some apparel for the El-camarón crew.
