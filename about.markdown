I live between the Netherlands and Italy, working as a data scientist for a company in the CRE domain (US MF market).

I am also trying to build my own quantamental trading framework.

I am deeply fascinated by probability and chances, especially when applied to gambling.

I am also into art, information security, rum, martial arts (taekwondo) and combat sports (boxing)

I wanna set sail with Kaya (the white dog) as soon as possible, so I'm looking for an Hallberg-Rassy to cruise the 7 seas.
