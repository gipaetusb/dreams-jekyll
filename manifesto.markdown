My name is Gio.

I've fallen in love with the sea and I wanna set sail with Kaya (the white dog) as soon as possible.
My first boat is El Camarón Pistola, a modest minicat. He (he's a grumpy catamaran, hence the male pronoun) will teach me some sailing how-to's. The first training ground will be the Garda waters, later we'll try the dutch shores.

`www.dreams.cash` was registered at random, perhaps as an alternative to social media, or may be because I wanted my own place on the internet. `Dreams` is because I'm a day-dreamer and I wanna encourage all of you to do the same. I chose `.cash` simply because it was cheaper than other domains but I could also argue that many dreams are in some way related to money: you may need money to fullfil your dream, you may dream just *about* money or about a world without any money (some say it's the root of all evil).

I think I'm gonna use this website to share some personal updates (e.g. progress with sailing) and publish some of my poor drawings. I may also produce some (eco-friendly) clothings and sell 'em.

I make a living working as a data scientist for [GeoPhy](wwww.geophy.com). Find me on:

+ [github](github.com/gipaetusb) (you'll find mostly systematic trading stuff)
+ [twitter](twitter.com/gipaetusb)
+ [instagram](instagram.com/dreams.cash) (the drawings again)

I dream of a ketch to cruise the 7 seas.
